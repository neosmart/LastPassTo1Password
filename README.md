# LastPass to 1Password migration tool

This is a free and open-source (Windows-only) tool to migrate a LastPass csv export to a format supported by 1Password for import.

It was developed in light of the author's discovery of a number of critical security issues in LastPass infrastructure that drove him to migrate to an alternative.

As of 2022, 1Password has released their own (closed-source) migration tool for previous LastPass users, which you may prefer to use instead.
